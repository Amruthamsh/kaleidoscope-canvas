The "Kaleidoscope Canvas" project is an interactive drawing tool created using P5.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This innovative tool replicates the captivating behavior of a kaleidoscope, providing users with a unique and visually stimulating drawing experience. Inspired by the captivating patterns of a traditional kaleidoscope, this piece allows users to draw on a canvas, which are then mirrored and repeated in a circular pattern, simulating the kaleidoscopic effect. 

This project aims to provide an engaging and visually stimulating experience for users, allowing them to explore the principles of symmetry and repetition through interactive creation. It showcases the creative potential of P5.js and demonstrates the integration of web technologies for artistic expression.
